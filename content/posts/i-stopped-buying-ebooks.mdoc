title: I stopped buying ebooks
excerpt: >-
  I love my Kindle, and for years, it was my exclusive reading companion. But lately, 
  I've found myself gravitating back to physical books. It's not just about the feel of 
  paper under my fingers or the satisfying smell of a new book — though I do love these things. 
  It's about ownership. After watching Amazon exercise their control over the devices and content 
  they sell, I've realized that maybe the convenience of digital isn't worth giving up the permanence 
  of physical books.

I love my Kindle. It's one of the best purchases that I've ever made. For a
long time, I read exclusively on my Kindle. I stopped buying physical books
for several reasons:

Collecting physical books seemed like a vanity project. I loved the idea of
having a home library but I felt like it was partly to impress others. I've
since changed my mind — having a home library sounds awesome. I don't care
if there's a little vanity in my desire to have a personal library.

There was also real environmental impact in buying physical books. Paper costs
trees, and I wanted to do my part in reducing deforestation.

Having a Kindle is convenient, especially when I'm traveling. My Kindle takes
little space and stores hundreds of books. The model I have — Kindle Paperwhite
Signature Edition — has a backlight and dark mode. I can control the color
temperature to minimize blue light, making it perfect for reading in bed at night.

Lately, I haven't been reading on my Kindle. I stopped buying ebooks and
audiobooks. The last ebook I bought for my Kindle was close to a year ago.
I've bought over 40 physical books since then. I missed reading physical books.

Reading a physical book, engages more than just your eyes. I can feel the
roughness of the papers in my fingers. Even turning the pages is satisfying.
I love the smell of a new book and it's the first thing I do when I open a
book I had just bought.

When reading non-fiction books, I highlight passages and write notes on the
inside of the cover pages. While highlighting on the Kindle is easy, writing
notes on it is not. Collecting the highlights and notes after reading a book
is easy with services like Readwise that will automatically sync it with
Obsidian or Notion. But I prefer taking notes directly in the books. They
are always there when I need them. It takes a bit of time but manually
transcribing the highlights and notes to Obsidian also reinforces the core
ideas of the book.

The final reason that I stopped buying ebooks: Amazon. When you buy an ebook
on Amazon, you don't own it — you're just buying a license to access the book.
Amazon can change or revoke that license at their discretion and they have.
They once deleted George Orwell's 1984 from thousands of Kindles. Amazon did
however, refund the users.  They have changed the book cover of The Wheel of Time
to promote their TV adaptation. I don't have The Wheel of Time, but I've seen
the same thing happen to Dune. The point is, Amazon has unrestricted control over
devices and content that we paid for. Changing the cover of a book seems pretty
harmless. But it gets worse.

In February 2023, Puffin automatically updated Roald Dahl e-books with
"sanitized" versions containing hundreds of changes to the original text.
Users weren't given a choice or notification.

I haven't read Roald Dahl's books, but this is disgusting. Dahl died in 1990.
Editing his work this way destroys his original intent, historical context and
sets a dangerous precedent, especially in today's political climate when everything
has to fit a particular narrative. While Puffin is the culprit, Amazon's allowing
these forced updates makes them partly responsible.

Now Amazon is removing the ability to download ebooks to PCs after February
26th. Users can only download directly to their Kindle via wifi. This makes
old Kindles without internet access obsolete. I have newer Kindle but how can
I trust that it won't be made obsolete in the future? As someone who has almost
a hundred ebooks, I can't accept losing access to books I paid for or having
their content changed after purchase.

Steam does the same with games. They recently started explicitly stating on
their checkout page that we're only buying a license. Amazon and Steam are
both monopolies in their industry. Steam to their credit, hasn't pulled the
rug out yet (that I know of). I'll keep buying games from Steam because
that's where the games I play and want to play are published.

With Amazon, I have other options. I can still buy physical books (sometimes,
begrudgingly, on Amazon). I've rediscovered the joy of visiting bookstores — it
gets me out of the house and helps me discover new books.

I acknowledge the environmental impact of physical books and am looking for
ways to offset it. I also haven't overlooked the convenience of an ebook
reader. I'm considering moving to other readers like Kobo, but I'll need a
new store where I can actually own what I buy. As for my current ebooks,
I've downloaded my Kindle library in its entirety for offline storage.
