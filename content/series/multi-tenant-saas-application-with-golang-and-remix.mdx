title: Multi-tenant SaaS Application with Golang and Remix
---
In this series, I'll walk you through building a multi-tenant SaaS application. The application is backed by a REST API written in Golang and the user interface built with Remix, Vite, and React.

I'll cover topics like schema design for multi-tenacy, authentication and authorization, connecting the frontend to the backend, and more.
